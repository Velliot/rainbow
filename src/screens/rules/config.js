        LGBTQ+ Travel.

        It’s okay to end the date early if you’re feeling uncomfortable. In fact, it’s encouraged.
        And if your instincts are telling you something is off or you feel unsafe, ask the bartender
        or server for help. Be careful while traveling. We recognize and believe in the importance
        of being inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations, but the reality is
        this: nowhere in the world is without potential risk, and some countries have specific laws
        that target LGBTQ+ people.
        <br /> Check out the laws around you when you travel to a new place and research what types
        of legal protection, if any, are available to you based on sexual orientation. In the event
        that you’re in unsafe territory, we suggest toggling off “Show me on RNBW CLUB” which you
        can find under the settings page. If you have added a sexual orientation to your profile and
        choose to be shown on RNBW CLUB, we will hide your sexual proentation from your profile
        untill you leave that area.
        <br />
        It’s important to exercise extra caution if you choose to connect with new people in these
        countries - as some law enforcement have been known to use dating apps as tools for
        potential entrapment. Some countries have also recently introduced laws that criminalize
        communications between individuals on same-sex dating applications or websites and even
        aggravate penalties if that communication leads to sexual encounters.

        Consent.

        Our goal is to create and foster a safe, and personal community for which to meet and engage

            We strive to foster a community where all members feel comfortable and their privacy is

                Our team and membership committee have been rigorously vetted, and are under strict

                We only select community members who we believe will adhere to our code of conduct
                and respecting the privacy of our members – and who have agreed to do so pursuant to
                these Terms of Use.
              </li>
              <li>
                We periodically review our community and remove members who are not acting in
                accordance with our code of conduct or the below Terms of Use or who are otherwise
                engaging in disrespectful, inappropriate or improper behavior.

            aren’t comfortable for any reason. Doing so will preserve conversations you’ve had with
            other members but will prevent any new members from seeing your profile. We have also
            made “social mode” and location services easy to toggle on and off so that you have full
            transparency and control over your location information at all times.

        In short, you are the most important thing to us. Your comfort, safety, and trust in our
        community are the things we care most about, and we will never compromise that. Our
        community is different. If you're a current member and have read this far - because you're
        one of those people who has concerns - yet wants to use RNBW CLUB, then we’re talking to
        you… YOU are the reason we built this. We understand that joining an app of this nature is a
        “first” for many of you. Therefore, every decision we make comes from our desire to provide
        you the experience you have hoped this would be. Should you ever have any questions
        regarding these Terms of Use, your application, membership, or any other aspect of our
        Service, please feel free to contact us at contact@RNBW CLUBtheapp.com.

        In order to gain access to the app, prospective users will be asked to complete a brief
        application, with accepted users being offered membership for a fee to be paid via the Apple
        in-app payment system. All applications will be considered; however, we have complete
        control and discretion regarding who is granted membership to the app. Those who are not
        granted access will be placed on our waitlist, which is continually reviewed for additional
        applicants to be admitted.

        conditions thereof. We reserve the right to raise or lower the cost of our membership fees,
        in-app purchases and other charges, and to create additional tiers or types of membership,
        at any time. We do not offer refunds for any reason other than as set forth in the Terms of

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Arbitration and Governing Law.</b> <br />
            Except for users residing within the European Union, Norway and elsewhere where
            prohibited by applicable law, the exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim
            arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof)
            or the Service shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration
            Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the
            right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of
            competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you
            may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class
            action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding. By using the
            Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU
            WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the
            Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO WAIVE
            YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will
            be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. You are entitled to a fair
            hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but
            you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined
            than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable
            in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Any proceeding
            to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or
            vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In
            the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable,
            any litigation against the Company may be commenced only in the federal or state courts
            located in the State of Delaware. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of
            those courts for such purposes and WAIVE YOUR RIGHT, IF ANY, TO A JURY TRIAL in such
            actions. These Terms of Use, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be
            governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts
            of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal
            Arbitration Act. For users residing in any jurisdiction where this arbitration agreement
            is prohibited by law, the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding Delaware’s conflict
            of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms of
            Use. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the Services but not
            eligible for arbitration will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts
            located in the State of Delaware and you and RNBW CLUB consent to personal jurisdiction
            in those courts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Indemnification.</b> <br />
            You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents
            subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand,
            including reasonable attorney’s fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of
            your breach of or failure to comply with these Terms of Use (including any breach of
            your representations and warranties contained herein), any event that you promote,
            market, create, host or invite others to using the Service, any postings or content you
            post in the Service, and the violation of any law or regulation by you. The Company
            reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise
            subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with the
            Company in connection therewith.

          <li>
            <b>Event Creators and Hosts.</b> <br />

            these Terms of Use, by utilizing the Service to, directly or indirectly in any manner
            whatsoever, create, host, promote, or invite others to a private or public event, you
            acknowledge and agree that (i) the Company is not responsible for the event or any
            aspect thereof, including, but not limited to, the behavior or safety of any attendee,
            (ii) you will not promote, market or refer to the event as a “RNBW CLUB event” or
            otherwise indicate or give the impression that RNBW CLUB has any involvement with the
            event other than as an invitation platform, and (iii) you agree to indemnify and hold
            the Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents subsidiaries and affiliates,
            harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorney’s
            fees, made by any third party relating to the event.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Notice.</b> <br />
            The Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding these Terms of Use,
            using any reasonable means, which may include email, SMS, MMS, text message or postings
            in the Service. Such notices may not be received if you violate these Terms of Use by
            accessing the Service in an unauthorized manner. You agree that you are deemed to have
            received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the Service
            in an authorized manner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Entire Agreement; Miscellaneous.</b> <br />
            These Terms of Use, together with the Privacy Policy, comprise the entire agreement
            between you and the Company regarding the use of the Service. If any provision of these
            Terms of Use are held invalid, the remainder hereof shall continue in full force and
            effect. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
            these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree
            that your RNBW CLUB account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your profile
            or contents within your RNBW CLUB account terminate upon your death or termination from
            the Service. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment is created as a result
            of these Terms of Use and you may not make any representations or bind the Company in
            any manner.
          </li>
          <li>

        <b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br />
        <br />
        RNBW CLUB App, Inc. (“RNBW CLUB,” the “Company,” “we,” and “us”) is committed to maintaining
        a safe and trustworthy private community and we understand that privacy and confidentiality
        are of the utmost importance to our members, applicants, attendees and other users (“you”).
        Your privacy is a top priority in everything that we do and every feature that we develop.
        To that end, the policy set forth below (the “Privacy Policy”) reflects our commitment to
        protecting your privacy and describes the information we collect, how that information may
        be used, and with whom it may be shared. We have attempted to describe the policy in plain
        language, limiting legal and technical jargon where possible. By using our application (the
        “App”), certain features thereof, or related services, including, but not limited to, those
        related to RSVPing and/or attending events which are advertised, featured, hosted or
        otherwise disseminated through the App (collectively, the “Service”), you are agreeing to be
        bound by the terms described herein. This Privacy Policy applies to all use by you of the
        Service. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use carefully and
        contact us at contact@RNBW CLUBtheapp.com with any questions you may have. We will
        occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our data collection
        and use practices, the features of our Service, or advances in technology. When we make
        changes, we will revise the “updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy, which will be
        posted at
        <a href="#privacy">https://rnbw.netlify.app/club-rules#privacy</a>. We encourage you to
        regularly check for the most recent version, as your continued use of the Service following
        the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you consent to and acceptance
        thereof. If you do not consent to such changes you can terminate your account at any time as
        described in our Terms of Use.

        <b>COLLECTING INFORMATION</b> <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Information You Provide in Connection with Membership.</b> <br />
            In order to apply for membership to the App, you will be asked to begin an application
            using certain credentials such as your Instagram handle, contact information, and phone
            contacts, among other things. Upon doing so, you authorize us to access information from
            your Instagram account, such as your username, profile picture, biography, website, list
            of followers, list of people you follow, and number of pictures, as well as your phone
            contacts. This information is used to verify your identity and to evaluate your
            real-world connection to our existing members, among other things. You will also be
            asked to allow us to collect your geographical location information and you may respond
            to such request by allowing us to collect location information at all times, only while
            you are using the App or not at all. Further, you may be asked if you would like to
            display your specific location to other users. The disclosure of your location to other
            users is not required for you to use the Service and may be enabled or disabled by you
            at any time through the App settings. In addition, we may collect and store any personal
            information you provide in connection with your application, while using our Service,
            which may include, identifying information such as your name, Instagram handle, email
            address, date of birth, gender, hometown, city of residence, telephone number, phone
            contacts, and listed friends currently using the App. In connection with your use of the
            Service, you may also provide us images, song selections, a biographical description,
            information about your gender and preferences for recommendations and connections. Some
            of the information that you provide may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in
            certain jurisdictions. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our
            processing of it. Any information you provide may be viewable by other users of the
            Service. If you communicate with other users within the Service, you provide us the
            content of your conversation. Should you contact us with an inquiry, we may collect the
            content of that correspondence or interaction. You may change your personal information
            (other than your date of birth) at any time within the App settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Information Other Users Provide.</b> <br />
            In addition to the information that you choose to provide to us, other users may provide
            information about you as they use the Service if, for instance, they contact us about
            you or you are a contact in their phone.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Information Collected Automatically.</b> <br />
            In addition to the information you provide, certain information will be automatically
            collected as you use the Service, including, but not limited to, the operation system
            used by your device, your device type and ID, your IP address, how and how often you
            interact with other users and your access times. If you grant us permission to use
            location services, we will automatically collect data regarding your geographical
            location at all times or while the App is actively running, depending on the permission
            that you grant us. Note that even if you do not grant us permission to use location
            services, we may collect data regarding your city, state and general location (not your
            exact location) through your IP address.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Third Party Websites.</b> <br />
            In the event you access a third-party website through our in-app browser, such
            third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information from you. You
            should consult the privacy statements available on such websites as their policies are
            beyond our control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Financial information.</b> <br />
            As we exclusively accept payment through third party services such as Apple and Stripe,
            we will never ask for your credit card information and your financial details are, and
            will remain, secured by and subject to the applicable third party’s security and privacy
            policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cookies and Other Similar Data Collection Technologies.</b> <br />
            We may use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you and/or your device. This
            may be done to, among other reasons, authenticate you, remember your preferences and
            settings, analyze usage trends and allow you access to certain features of the App. Some
            devices and web browsers have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature signaling that a user
            does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. Not all devices and browsers
            offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform, so, for this reason, RNBW CLUB,
            like many companies, does not currently respond to DNT signals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Data Controller Information.</b> <br />
            The Company is responsible for the maintenance and safeguarding of your information
            under this Privacy Policy. The Company can be reached at contact@RNBW CLUBtheapp.com and
            will promptly respond to all inquiries regarding your data.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </>,
      <>
        <b>SHARING AND USE OF INFORMATION</b> <br />
        <br />
        The personal information that you provide is used only in connection with the Service. We
        will never sell your personal information to any third party and we do not disclose your
        personal information to any third party without your permission; provided, however, that we
        use information internally and with select third-party analytics services to improve and
        operate the Service, as described below.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Information Shared with Other Users.</b> <br />
            When you register as a user of the Service, your App profile will be viewable by other
            users of the Service. Such other users will be able to view information you have
            provided to us directly or through Instagram, such as your Instagram username, photos
            you upload, your first name, your age, city of residence, hometown, your biography, and
            information you have in common with the person viewing your profile, such as mutually
            followed Instagram accounts. A mutual “like” by you and another user enables you to chat
            with that person through the Service. Should you engage in a conversation through our
            Service via text chat, status post or video chat, that user with whom you are
            communicating will see the content of that interaction. By submitting an application to
            RNBW CLUB, you are giving the App access to your Instagram profile through the use of
            Instagram’s API. However, the Instagram information automatically available to users of
            the App will not exceed the information otherwise accessible through your Instagram
            profile. Therefore, a “private” Instagram user profile will still be private; only the
            content you choose to share with RNBW CLUB users will be visible. If you are not a
            member of the App, but RSVP to an event using our Events service, whether upon receiving
            a text message invitation or otherwise, your name and phone number may be made available
            to other users of the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Waitlisted Applicants.</b> <br />
            Only other users whose applications have been accepted will be able to see your App
            profile. Applicants who have been waitlisted will have no way to know or see that you
            are a member of the RNBW CLUB community just as users cannot see which applicants have
            been waitlisted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Use of Information By RNBW CLUB.</b> <br />
            We may use information that we collect about you to, among other things, (i) create and
            manage your account, (ii) manage events, RSVP lists and otherwise operate and improve
            the Events feature, (iii) deliver and improve the Service, including developing new
            features, (iv) facilitate and monitor use, content and interactions among users, (v)
            perform research, analysis and analytics internally or by using a third party service
            such as Google Analytics, (vi) manage our business, (vii) communicate with you and
            (viii) enforce or exercise rights under our Terms of Use. Information that we disclose
            to Google Analytics is subject to{" "}

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Service providers; Promotional Partners.</b> <br />
            We may share non-personal, non-identifiable information with third parties that perform
            services on our behalf or that provide promotional benefits to you as a RNBW CLUB
            member. These service providers and promotional partners may have access to such
            non-personal, non-identifiable information needed to perform their functions but are not
            permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Other Situations.</b> <br />
            We may disclose your information in connection with (i) certain legal matters and to
            ensure legal compliance, (ii) a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order,
            or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency, (iii) a
            significant corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business or its assets, or
            (iv) your consent or request that we do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information.</b> <br />
            In addition to the uses of your personal information referenced above, we may use and
            share non-personal, non-identifiable information we collect through your use of the
            Service. We may also use and share aggregated, non-personal information with third
            parties including advisors, investors and professionals for purposes related to our
            business.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Legal Bases for Processing your Information.</b> <br />
            We rely on the following legal bases in processing your information: (i) most of the
            time, the reason we process your information is to perform the contract that you have
            with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful
            connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, to make
            it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you; (ii) we may also use your
            information where we have legitimate interests to do so (for instance, we analyze users’
            behavior to improve the Service and develop new features, and we process information for
            administrative, fraud detection and other legal purposes); and (iii) finally, from time
            to time we may ask for your consent to use your information for certain specific
            reasons. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at{" "}

        <b>KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</b> <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Cross-Border Data Transfers.</b> <br />
            Sharing of information referenced above sometimes involves cross-border data transfers,
            for instance to the United States and other jurisdictions. As an example, the personal
            information of users located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) is transferred to
            countries outside of the EEA. In doing so, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that
            personal information remains protected. For instance, we use standard contract clauses
            approved by the European Commission or other suitable safeguards to permit data
            transfers from the EEA to other countries. Standard contractual clauses are commitments
            between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and
            security of your data. If you would like to receive additional information on the
            safeguards that we implement, please contact us at{" "}

          <li>
            <b>Security Measures; No Liability.</b> <br />
            We take the security of your information very seriously and have implemented a number of
            measures to safeguard it. Despite our efforts, no system is guaranteed to be completely
            secure. While we have taken, and will continue to take, reasonable actions to regularly
            update and improve our security, including regularly monitoring our systems for possible
            vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly reviewing our information collection
            practices, we do not promise, nor you should expect, that your information, chats, or
            other communications will always remain secure. We have no liability to you or to any
            third party arising out of any loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
            Users outside of the United States should note that your information may be transferred
            to our servers which are hosted within or outside the United States. By using the
            Service you consent to the transfer of your information to countries which may not
            provide the same level of protection available in your country of residence. If you
            believe that your account or information is no longer secure, or otherwise have
            information that may be relevant to us regarding information security, please notify us
            immediately at{" "}

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Retaining Your Information.</b> <br />
            We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business
            purposes and as permitted by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of our
            users on and off the Service, we implement a safety retention window of three months
            following account deletion. During this period, account information will be retained
            although the account will of course not be visible on the App. In practice, we delete or
            anonymize your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention
            window) or after two years of continuous inactivity, unless (i) we must keep it to
            comply with applicable law; (ii) there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute
            requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or (iii) the
            information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention
            and enhancing users' safety and security. Keep in mind that even though our systems are
            designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we
            cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to
            technical constraints.

        <b>TEXT MESSAGES AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS</b> <br />
        By using the Service in any capacity, including RSVPing to an event or otherwise engaging
        with our Events feature, you agree to receive text messages and other correspondence from us
        regarding event update as well as upcoming events, features, and other promotional matters,

            <b>Tools to Control Your Information.</b> <br />
            We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the
            following tools: (i) account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete
            information that you provided to us and that is associated with your account directly
            within the Service; (ii) mobile device permission systems for specific types of device
            data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push
            notifications, which you can use to change your settings on your device to either
            consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the
            corresponding notifications; and (iii) you can delete your account at any time by using
            the corresponding functionality directly on the Service. You can also, at any time in
            your sole discretion, withdraw any consent that you give us with respect to your
            personal information. To withdraw your consent, or if you have any question regarding

            <b>Key Points to Remember.</b> <br />
            We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. You should remember that you have the
            following rights with respect to your information: (i) you may review the personal
            information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right
            of access, right of portability or variations of those terms) and you can request a copy
            of your personal information by putting in such a request through{" "}
            <a href="mailto:info@revelationfactory.com">info@revelationfactory.com</a>; (ii) if you
            believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer
            entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its
            processing, please contact us at contact@RNBW CLUBtheapp.com; (iii) you may direct us to
            restrict or “block” the processing of personal information in certain circumstances,
            such as where you contest its accuracy or object to our processing of the information;
            (iv) you have the right to obtain your personal information that you provided to us and
            you may use such information elsewhere. For your protection and the protection of all of
            our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above
            requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the
            request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or
            the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another
            user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service,
            the other user will have to contact us to provide their written consent before the
            information is released. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to
            object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not
            allow us to provide our Service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our
            service if we do not have your date of birth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Uninstall and Accountability.</b> <br />
            Remember that you can stop all information collection at any time by uninstalling the
            App using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the App from
            your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to
            be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able
            to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities. In certain
            countries, including those in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint
            with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process
            your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with
            notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are
            established.
